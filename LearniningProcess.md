# Learning Process

## Question 1
**Feynman Technique**

The Feynman Technique is explaining something to someone in simple terms, like teaching a friend. Which helps him understand it better.

## Question 2
**Most Interesting Idea from Barbara Oakley’s TED Talk**

The most interesting part for me was when she shared how she struggled with maths in the past but become a master of it later. It shows that with the right approach, anything is achiveable.

## Question 3
**Active vs Diffused Modes of Thinking**
- **Active Mode**: When one is focused and trying hard to learn something.
- **Diffused Mode**: When the brain is relaxed and connecting ideas in the background, like when one is walking, showering, or just chilling. Both the modes are important for better learning.

## Question 4
**Steps to Take When Starting a New Topic (from "Learn Anything in 20 Hours")**
- Break the skill into smaller parts.
- Focus on learning only what you need..
- Remove or decrease distractions.
- Practice for at least 20 hours.

## Question 5
**Ways to Improve Your Learning Process**
- Explain things in simple words, as if you are teaching someone.
- Give yourself time for both focused study and relaxed thinking.
- switch-off your phone and avoid social media while studying.
- Use apps to track the time and stay productive.
- Make learning fun by connecting it to real-life.
- Do not rush. Only focus on understanding the topic.
- Practice more and explain what you have learned.
